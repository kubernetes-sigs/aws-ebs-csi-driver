[ACTION REQUIRED] Update to the EBS CSI Driver IAM Policy

Due to an upcoming change in handling of IAM polices for the CreateVolume API when creating a volume from an EBS snapshot, a change to your EBS CSI Driver policy may be needed. For more information and remediation steps, see GitHub issue #2190 (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/issues/2190). This change affects all versions of the EBS CSI Driver and action may be required even on clusters where the driver is not upgraded.
