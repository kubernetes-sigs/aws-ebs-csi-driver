# CreateVolume Parameters
There are several optional parameters that may be passed into `CreateVolumeRequest.parameters` map, these parameters can be configured in StorageClass, see [example](../examples/kubernetes/storageclass).

The AWS EBS CSI Driver supports [tagging](tagging.md) through `StorageClass.parameters` (in v1.6.0 and later). 

| Parameters                  | Values                                 | Default  | Description         |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------|---------------------|
| "csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype" | xfs, ext2, ext3, ext4                  | ext4     | File system type that will be formatted during volume creation. This parameter is case sensitive! |
| "type"                      | io1, io2, gp2, gp3, sc1, st1,standard  | gp3*     | EBS volume type     |
| "iopsPerGB"                 |                                        |          | I/O operations per second per GiB. Required when io1 or io2 volume type is specified. If this value multiplied by the size of a requested volume produces a value above the maximum IOPs allowed for the volume type, as documented [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html), AWS will cap the IOPS to maximum supported value. If the value is lower than minimal supported IOPS value per volume, either error is returned (the default behavior) or the value is increased to fit into the supported range when `allowautoiopspergbincrease` is `"true"`.|
| "allowAutoIOPSPerGBIncrease"| true, false                            | false    | When `"true"`, the CSI driver increases IOPS for a volume when `iopsPerGB * <volume size>` is too low to fit into IOPS range supported by AWS. This allows dynamic provisioning to always succeed, even when user specifies too small PVC capacity or `iopsPerGB` value. On the other hand, it may introduce additional costs, as such volumes have higher IOPS than requested in `iopsPerGB`.|
| "iops"                      |                                        | 3000     | I/O operations per second. Only effetive when gp3 volume type is specified. If empty, it will set to 3000 as documented [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html). |
| "throughput"                |                                        | 125      | Throughput in MiB/s. Only effective when gp3 volume type is specified. If empty, it will set to 125MiB/s as documented [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html). |
| "encrypted"                 |                                        |          | Whether the volume should be encrypted or not. Valid values are "true" or "false" |
| "kmsKeyId"                  |                                        |          | The full ARN of the key to use when encrypting the volume. Amazon EBS automatically creates a unique AWS managed key in each region where you store AWS resources. This KMS key has the alias `/aws/ebs`. If not specified, Amazon EBS uses the generated KMS key for encryption by default |
